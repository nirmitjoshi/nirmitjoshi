>I see someone crying alone on a bench, I think it’s funny. You see a little girls who’s lost her puppy, you’re sad.

## **The Beginning**
Let's rewind to where it all began - a burning desire to seize control. And when I say control, I mean not just the keyboard but the wild and unpredictable dance of life itself. You see, I'm not your run-of-the-mill perfectionist; I'm the kind who wants to micromanage every pixel on life's grand screen. Why let fate pull the strings in your life's puppet show when you can be the puppet master with just a few lines of code?

## **The Change**
Life can get pretty monotonous if you let it. So, I'd periodically shake things up. New operating system? Bam. Crafting the perfect computer setup? Nailed it. Creating the ultimate note-taking system? Of course. And just for the sheer thrill of it, I'd even shave my head. Why? Because, my friend, change is the spice of life.

## **~~College~~**
Fast forward to college - the place where most people settle into routines. But not me, no sir! The monotony continued to haunt me, so I decided to be on a journey of my own making. Instead of succumbing to the daily grind of classes from 8 to 6, I dived into developing projects just for the sheer thrill of it. Who needs a degree when you can code your destiny, right?

## **Present**
Now, here's my newest adventure → learning Rust! Why? Because life's too short for boredom.
